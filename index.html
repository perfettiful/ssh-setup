                    As a developer, having a platform to host the code you write is very important.
                    Expect to write a lot of code locally in addition to pushing your
                    code to a remote repository on services such as GitLab or GitHub. SSH keys allows
                    us to connect our computer to GitHub and easily push or pull any changes in our repository. However,
                    there is a process to establishing that relationship between your computer and
                    your remote repositories on GitHub or GitLab, and it can be tricky to set up.
                    <br><br>
                    There are many guides out there that overwhelm the reader with various SSH protocols and jargon
                    that might intimidate or confuse newer developers. This guide aims to assist newer developers with
                    establishing an SSH connection with their local machine and their remote repositories, all while
                    keeping
                    explanations and instructions simple and straightforward.

                <h1>Check for existing SSH Key</h1>
                <br>
                <code>IMPORTANT: If you've already have an SSH Key generated, it can be reused!</code>

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter <code>ls -al ~/.ssh</code> in your terminal (Git Bash for Windows or Terminal for macOS)
                        to see if any existing SSH keys are present. Look for a public SSH key that ends in
                        <code>.pub</code>. For example, <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, <code>id_ecdsa.pub</code>, or
                        <code>id_ed25519.pub</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you see an existing SSH key pair (a public SSH key like id_rsa.pub and a private SSH key like
                        id_rsa), then you can skip generating a new SSH key and use your existing keys to add to the
                        ssh-agent in a later step</li>

                    <li>If you receive an error that it doesn't exist, that means you'll need to generate a new SSH key
                        pair, which we will do next!</li>

                <p>
                    Like I said earlier, the SSH key is important for establishing the connection between your computer
                    and
                    GitHub (or whichever repository service you use). Here are the steps to generating the key:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Windows users, open GitLab organization. Bash.</li>
                    <li>For MacOS users, the default terminal will be fine.</li>
                    <li>Enter <code>ssh-keygen</code>, it will begin generating the key.</li>
                    <li>You will be prompted multiple times, keep hitting enter until no more prompts appear.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After running <code>ssh-keygen</code>, your terminal should look like this:</p>
                <img src="assets/output.png" alt="console-output">
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to generating the key! Albeit we used the
                    quickest method to do it. We actually just generated two keys, but really we only need the public
                    key.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first key we generated, inside <code>id_rsa</code>, is the private key, this key exists only
                        on our machine
                        and should NOT be shared with anyone (hence why it's private).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second one, inside <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, is the public key. This is the one we need to
                        share with whatever service
                        we're using to complete the connection.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Grabbing the Public Key</h1>
                <p>
                    The public key we just generated needs to be shared with whatever service we're using in order for
                    the connection to be completely
                    established. In order to copy the key to our clipboard, we need to navigate to the
                    <code>.ssh/</code> directory, which is located in our
                    home directory.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In your terminal, type <code>cd ~/.ssh/</code> and hit enter. This folder contains all things
                        SSH, including our private and public keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type <code>cat id_rsa.pub</code> and hit enter. Your public key will be displayed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the entire key and hit <code>CTRL+C</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>All that's left to do is add our key to any repository hosting service of our choice. The following
                    steps will entail how to add your key to GitHub and GitLab.</p>
